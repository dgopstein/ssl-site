Computers are a pervasive and powerful part of our everyday lives.  Unfortunately, due to poor security design, they often also present substantial risk to our privacy and safety.

The Secure Systems Laboratory (SSL) at New York University, under the
direction of Professor [Justin Cappos](personalpages/jcappos/), works
to find practical and
deployable solutions to real-world security threats.   Over the past few
years, the lab has developed products and improved on existing system
designs that [detect](projects#crashsimulator) and
[isolate](projects#lind) security faults, [secure](projects#pph)
[private](projects#sensibility) [data](projects#uppir),
provide a [secure mechanism](projects#tuf) for fixing software flaws in
[different contexts](projects#uptane), and even foster a deeper
understanding about how to help programmers avoid 
[security](projects#blindspots) [flaws](projects#atoms) in the first place.

We focus on deploying our solutions in practice to maximize the impact
of our work.  In addition to the software we
[distribute](projects#seattle),
our technology is used in a
variety of popular products including [Docker](https://www.docker.com/),
[git](https://git-scm.com/), and the package managers for most [Linux
distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux).
